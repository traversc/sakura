\title{sakura: Extension to R Serialization}
\description{
Extends the functionality of R serialization by augmenting the built-in
reference hook system. This enhanced implementation allows an integrated
single-pass operation that combines R serialization with third-party
serialization methods. Facilitates the serialization of even complex R
objects, which contain non-system reference objects, such as those accessed
via external pointers, to enable their use in parallel and distributed
computing.
