Title: Extension to R Serialization
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Description: Extends the functionality of R serialization by augmenting the
    built-in reference hook system. This enhanced implementation allows optimal,
    one-pass integrated serialization that combines R serialization with
    third-party serialization methods. Facilitates the serialization of even
    complex R objects, which contain non-system reference objects, such as those
    accessed via external pointers, for use in parallel and distributed
    computing.
