Title: Extension to R Serialization
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Description: Extends the functionality of R serialization by augmenting the
    built-in reference hook system. This enhanced implementation allows an
    integrated single-pass operation that combines R serialization with
    third-party serialization methods. Facilitates the serialization of even
    complex R objects, which contain non-system reference objects, such as those
    accessed via external pointers, to enable their use in parallel and
    distributed computing.
